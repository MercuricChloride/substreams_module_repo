* Substreams Module Repo ðŸ”­

A collection of some handy dandy Substreams modules, build by @blind_nabler from @SpyglassLabs

To use this repo and play around and modify the src_sh[:exports code]{run.sh} or just run it directly. The shell script is written in fish, but i'll update it to bash shortly.

* Hotdog Powered ðŸŒ­

This whole repo revolves around a protobuf type called Hotdog, which is an attempt at adding some sort of dynamic typing to protobufs.

The name comes from the fact a hotdog has a particular shape and is identifiable, even if you don't know what's inside exactly.

Here is what it looks like:
#+begin_src protobuf
message Value {
  oneof value {
    int32 int64_value = 1;
    uint64 uint64_value = 2;
    string string_value = 3;
    Map map_value = 4;
  }
}

message Map {
  map<string, Value> keys = 1;
}

message Hotdog {
  string hotdog_name = 1;
  Map map = 2;
}
#+end_src

So we have a Hotdog, which has:
1. A unique name
2. A map of keys -> values (which can be more maps to keys -> values)

This gives us plenty of flexibility to work with just about any data, and be able to work with them / filter them for specific modules by filtering off the hotdog name.

Hotdogs at their core are just hashmaps with a name, so within helpers.rs there are some helpers to work with them.

#+begin_src rust
pub trait HotdogHelpers {
    fn to_hashmap(&self) -> HashMap<String, ValueEnum>;
    fn from_hashmap(map: HashMap<String, ValueEnum>) -> Self;
}
#+end_src

* Module Explanations

** map_events

This module maps all events from a contract.

The param string is of the form:
#+begin_src sh
CONTRACT_ADDRESS&&CONTRACT_ABI
#+end_src

This pattern can be repeated as such as well:
#+begin_src sh
CONTRACT_ADDRESS&&CONTRACT_ABI&&CONTRACT_ADDRESS&&CONTRACT_ABI
#+end_src

** filter_events
This module takes in an input from map_events, and filters out the events to only be of a particular name.

I know this isn't the performant way to do this, but all of this repo isn't geared for maximum performance we are testing things out right now!

So in addition to the map_events input string, this filter_events module takes a string of the form:
#+begin_src sh
EVENT_TO_TRACK
#+end_src

This can also be repeated
#+begin_src sh
EVENT_NAME&&ANOTHER_EVENT_NAME
#+end_src
** map_unique_users
A store that counts how many unique addresses have interacted with a contract.

Doesn't take an input other than map_events.
** graph_out
A module that takes in map_events as an input, and converts each event to it's EntityChanges table change equivalent.

Can be used to build out a subgraph with 2 modules which is pretty sick IMO!
